2. **Asset verification** - Confirmed new files exist before deployment
3. **Fallback functionality** - Funnel button has backup redirect
4. **Quick rollback** - Working commit ready if needed

## Current Status
- **Desktop site:** ✅ Working with .org domain
- **Mobile site:** ✅ Working with .org domain  
- **Funnel functionality:** ✅ Working with fallback
- **Google Tag tracking:** ✅ Present and configured
- **All forms:** ✅ Should work with .org domain

## Files Successfully Updated

## Old Asset Files

- All active functionality now uses .org domain
- Site is live and working at https://veteranlegacylife.org/
- No blank site issues occurred
- All safeguards worked as planned
